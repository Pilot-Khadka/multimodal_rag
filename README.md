## Multimodal RAG
**Status: Incomplete** – under active development

## Completed

- Text integration working
- Download and clean YouTube captions
- Text embedding with recursive splitting
- Image embedding using CLIP + histogram-based frame selection from videos
- Multirepresentational chunking
- CLI app

## Remaining 

- **Image Integration** –  core embeddings are done, needs hooking into pipeline  
- **Query Decomposition** –  multi-query, step-back, HyDE (probably?)
- **Hierarchical Chunking** –  add tree-like metadata or context windows  
- **Reranking / Rank Fusion** –  needs evaluation logic and ranker model
